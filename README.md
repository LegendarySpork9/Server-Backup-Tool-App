# Server-Backup-Tool-App
Server Backup Tool

Please feel free to use this app but note it only works with Minecraft Servers. The server must contain a "Start.bat" file which runs the server. Without this, it will not work.

This app will calculate the time between when it is opened and 2 am the following day. It will give three warnings before the backup. An hour before, half an hour before and 5 minutes before. Once it reaches 2 am, the app will stop the server, take the backup and then restart the server 30 seconds later. You can enter commands for the server through the app. There are three specific commands:

stop - stops the server
Start Server - starts the server
Exit App - closes the app and properly disposes of the resources

If you have any issues or improvement suggestions, please raise an issue and I'll look into it.
